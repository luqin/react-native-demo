## Prerequisites

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (Node 5 with npm 3 is required).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/luqin/react-native-demo
cd react-native-demo
npm install
```


## Start Development

React Native: [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

## Dev Tasks

- `react-native run-android`

## Production Tasks

## Documentation

For absolute beginners, see: [react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto).

So you've decided to give this web stack a chance, but where is the documentation? Code is documentation in itself as it illustrates various patterns, but to start with you should educate yourself on [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). You should [learn ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/) to refresh your knowledge about "new" JavaScript practices and syntax. This stack uses [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and class-less design for a [good reason](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/#the-case-for-immutability). [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/api/).
