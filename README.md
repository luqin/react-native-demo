## Documentation

For absolute beginners, see: [react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto).

So you've decided to give this web stack a chance, but where is the documentation? Code is documentation in itself as it illustrates various patterns, but to start with you should educate yourself on [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). You should [learn ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/) to refresh your knowledge about "new" JavaScript practices and syntax. This stack uses [immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and class-less design for a [good reason](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/#the-case-for-immutability). [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/api/).
